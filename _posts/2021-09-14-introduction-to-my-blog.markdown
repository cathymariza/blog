Everything from `jekyll`, `markdown` and `ruby` were new to me. I struggled with installing ruby and `jekyll` but also with creating my own post.I am still trying to fully understand how `jekyll` works but In learnt that it's a static site generator.

What I'm hoping to learn going forward:
* How ruby works
* How markdown is converted to markup

The links that were helpful as I out together this lab were [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and this `Youtube` [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo) .
