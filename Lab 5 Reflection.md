This lab has been a great learning experience as I was learning about using data modelling and how to create entity relationship diagrams, as well as schemas.

After reading the question(description), it didn't take me too long to figure out what the entities are and what the relationships between them are. I however had a hard time while navigating the Lucidchard website, because I had hiccups in finding where the entity templates are. I ended up figuring it out after playing around with the website for a bit.

I also had a really hard time  when I was tryong to upload the images of my schema and ERD. I tried more than five times and followed several turorials but I coudn't get the picture to be displayed. I schedule a meeting with Dr. Goadrich to resolve that issue.
