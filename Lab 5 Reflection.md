This lab has been a great learning experience as I was learning about using data modelling and how to create entity relationship diagrams, as well as schemas.

After reading the question(description), it didn't take me too long to figure out what the entities are and what the relationships between them are. I however had a hard time while navigating the Lucidchard website, because I had hiccups in finding where the entity templates are. I ended up figuring it out after playing around with the website for a bit.

The schema was as well not too hard but the tables took me some time to arrange and put things where they belong. I also tried adding FK for all the foreign keys but I couldn't find out where that was; and cardinality was also not allowing me to add any value I want. It just gave me three options and that was it. I scheduled a meeting with the professor to discuss about both of these issues. I also had a really hard time  when I was trying to upload the images of my schema and ERD. I tried more than five times and followed several turorials but I coudn't get the picture to be displayed. I'm also hoping to be able to discuss with Dr. Goadrich to resolve that issue as well.

Overall, the lab was a great learning experience about Data modelling. I started doing some more digging to expand my knowledge about it, especially schemas since these are the heart of creating databases.
