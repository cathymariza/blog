I started lab 7 last week and had a few hiccups initially, which slowed down my progress. I first installed Visual Studio and missed the instruction on setting it up with ASP.Net Core and had to uninstall and reinstall it again.

I finally got it to work and started along with the tutotial. I again had a challenge that slowed me down when I started working on the tutorial from `Microsoft`, because I wasn't sure if the tutorial had to go all the way untill the last Globalization and Migration(with embedded steps) but I worked with a classmate and we figured that we were required to only walk through Tutorials(please correct us if we are wrong).

I spent a lot of hours learning and working on this lab but I absolutely enjoyed seeing each piece come tigvether and the way the tutorial goes into details about the explanation of each step specifically.

Creating my own Razor Application was a bit of a challenge because I had to replicate a couple steps from the Tutorial and wasn't exactly sure if it was all right but I repeated a few steps and finally got it to work
