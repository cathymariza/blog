The project we worked on was creating a website that would help our partner, Arkansas Asset Builders, to get statistical reports, that they need to send to the IRS, easily. We were helping a non-profit to optimize their job and minimize the time spent on extracting reports amd knowing the statistics that could help them improve their business.

The skills we needed for this project icluded knowing how to use Frameworks like ASP.net Core that we used to create this website; knowing html, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and C#. It also required the ability to work with a Team for more than three months, which required consistency in communication, collaboration, patience and valuing everyone's opinion.

Earlier this project, I realized how much I liked having things communicated clearly but didn't do it as effectively as I did. So, I started making sure communication between us is consistent, and so did everybody on my team.

Durng this project, we were also able to let more people know about the wirk this Company is doing in the community, so as to help everyone who raise awareness to everyone who could benefit from this opportunity.

This company brings financial change in people's lives by helping them to do tax filing for free and also advise them on best ways to improve financially as their logo says "empower hard-working arkansans to flourish"
One of the things we were trying to get to during this project was to design our website in a way it generates refund scores and other statistical reports automatically, which the company would use to evaluate and improve their work, as well as see how much progress they have made.

Overall, this project helped me to realize different ways I can use the skills I am learning/getting in class to help create solutions that would improve people's lives.
