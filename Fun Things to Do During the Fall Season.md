The Fall Season is probably most people's favorite season of the year. This is because that's when the summer's high temperatures start tp fall and it becomes cool outside. The trees also start to change colors from green to pink, purple, orange, brown to mention but a few.

A lot of people prefer doing a lot of fun activities before temperatures fall below zero as winter kicks in. I out together a list of few activities that people can choose to do during this time

* Camping
* Decorating your mantel and house with some autumn decorations
* Take a fall foliage drive
* Go Apple Picking at an Orchard
* Eat candy corn

Fall is the best season to do outdoor activities(early in the fall) and have fun with family and friends.
