This lab has been a great learning experience as I was learning about using `Jekyll`to create my blog posts, as well as learning about markdown language.

At first, I had a hard time un derstamnding the instructions and how to correctly copy `post.html` and `header.html` from `_layouts` and `_includes` respectively  to my repository. I was partly confused and thought that I had to download a new theme for my blog and integrate it in my repository. I spent so much time trying to learn about it, installing the right themes and incorporating them in my project.

After a while, I came to office hours to get clarifications on how to do that and learnt that its doesn't require a new theme. Instead what we were tasked to do was to swap the date and title and observe how that looks in our blog.

I also was a bit confused when it came to changing the order of the title and dates in the post.html file but I also got help from the professor and got it figured out.

I'm still trying to understand the syntax of markdown and understnading how to write span tags, but I am working on it and trying to find as many explanations as I can.
