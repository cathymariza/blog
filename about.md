This is Cathy's blog. I will be sharing with you some of my favorite life tips that I think might be helpful to you as well.

I created this blog using the amazing Jekyll. I'll share with you my experience with Jekyll and how you can make good use of all the features and themes it has to create your own blog, if you're interested.

I'll also be updating the content regularly, so stay tuned! You can bookmark this blog by [clicking here](https://cathymariza.github.io/blog/)
