Lab 2 was the hardest lab I worked on in this class. This was mainly because some of the concepts explained in class very well and had to revise them as I was doing the lab.

I also had a really hard time understanding what AJAX and JSON are and what they do. Finally, after a watching a few tutorials, I understood what they both are and how they are different.

Another challenging thing I learned, but had a hard time with initially is DOM Nodes and jQuery Collections and how they differ. I figured this out after watching the tutorials on Khan Academy.

I am proud of what I learned during this lab. It surely wasn't easy but next time, instead of struggling alone with something that doesn't make sense to me, I will make sure to go to office hours and ask about it.

Javsascript is fun but it surely might be terrifying when someone first looks at it and sees different pieces that are involved when someone is incorporating it in their website/webpage; but once one understands it, it comes in handy.
